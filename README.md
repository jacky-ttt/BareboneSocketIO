# BareboneSocketIO

a repository includes
* android app as socketIO client
* nodejs socketIO server which hosts a website as client
* python socketIO server which hosts a website as client

I wrote a [medium article](https://medium.com/@jacky_ttt/socket-io-server-and-client-473148fd6826) about it.

### To start nodejs server
```
npm install
npm start
```

### To start python server
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
python app.py
```
*I use PyCharm to open the python project
